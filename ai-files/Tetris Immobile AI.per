;This Ai file has been created by Zanzard Lothar.
;Email: zanzard@hotmail.com
;
;Installation: Just unzip the two files in the AI subfolder of the AOK main folder.
;
;This file should work properly in AOK and in AOK:TC.
;
;The author would like to thank the Rasher, Herodotus, Magnus and Ingo Van Thiel for
;the help they provided in making the first Immobile Units AI.
;
;This Ai is supposed to make the Ai's villagers and military units stand still doing nothing.
;
;If enemy units come near the military units of the AI, the military units will move and attack the enemy
;units and then stand still again if the enemy units leave their sight or are vanquished. Military boats
;also should behave like this.
;
;Kings, villagers and transport ships of the AI will stand still and will try to run away if attacked.
;Units of the AI will execute orders given to them by triggers (at least most of the time).
;
;Feel free to use this AI in any scenario of AOK, and feel free to edit it to suit your needs.
;The author is not responsible for any problems created by edited version of this AI file.
;
;The Immobile Units AI comes with an extra feature: you can choose one of the 8 different
;kinds of behavior that the AI units will have about ranged units. To choose one of these,
;go to the "Terrain" tab of the map editor and under "Ai map type" choose one of the following:
;
;Archipelago: Ranged units tend to fight in a hit-and-run manner.
;Baltic: Units try to dodge enemy missiles that are shot against them.
;Black forest: Units try to do both of these 50% of the time.
;Coastal: Ranged units tend to fight in a hit-and-run manner and units try to dodge
;enemy missiles that are shot against them 50% of the time.
;Continental: Ranged units tend to fight in a hit-and-run manner 50% of the time amd units
;try to dodge missiles that are shot against them.
;Fortress: Ranged units tend to fight in a hit-and-run manner 50% of the time.
;Gold Rush: Units try to dodge enemy missiles that are shot against them 50% of the time.
;Highland: Units will always try to do both of these things.
;Any other map: Units will mostly not try to do neither of these.
;
;If the units are set to try to dodge enemy missiles shot at them, they will probably succeed
;more with slow shots, like trebuchets and mangonels, than with fast ones, like archers.
;
;The TRUE map type does not matter with the Immobile Units AI. For example, you can create a
;water-based map and choose the "black Forest" setting for the AI type without any problems,
;just as you can create a land-based map and choose the "archipelago" setting for the AI.
;
;What Immobile Units AI GOLD cannot provide:
;-Immobile fish boats (fish boats will not tend to stand still).
;-Immobile trade carts (to keep them still, make sure the player with the trade-cart has
;no markets, or that this player has no markets to trade with).
;-Trade cogs will behave just like trade carts, though they trade with docks.
;-Monks will pick up relics provided that they have a monk and a monastery and they can see the relic.
;-If the computer player has a single villager, the villager will not stand still.
;-If the computer player has a king and a building that can be garrisoned, then the king will
;try to garrison at this building, regardless of how far the building is from the king.
;
;If you find any other bugs or observations about the AI, post them as a comment on the
;description page of this AI file on AOKH blacksmith.
;
;Thank you for your interest in the Immobile Units AI GOLD!
